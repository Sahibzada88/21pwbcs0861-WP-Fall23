It's a travesty, there is no doubt about it! Now that the long radio silence is coming to an end it's time to prepare for a month in these magnificent islands. The flight from Sydney to Manila is a lazy eight hours, everything is super close and convenient for Aussies heading out to South East Asia. After an overnight stopover I boarded a domestic flight down to Cebu treasonably early in the morning. This was my second visit, and I booked a top rated hostel online for the stay before the trip. To my surprise, the hostel was not in Cebu City but further south, however after arriving it was certainly worth the minor inconvenience. Coincidentally two of the top attractions on the island are further south of Cebu, so it all worked out for the best. The staff at the hostel made me feel so welcome, the establishment is extremely well run and clean... with a bar! I settled in to a travel routine quickly, and an experienced local traveller sat down with me and patiently planned out a proposed itinerary for the month, based on my wishes and his knowledge. So I found myself spending at least half a day online, working backwards from the final domestic flight until I had booked an entire itinerary for the trip. All of the flights had to re-route through Cebu, which is just a minor inconvenience. Of course I also locked in a few ferry trips to complete the picture. So there I was, with a full month to look forward to, and all I had to do was stay healthy, be positive, and try to make every post a winner. The sense of excitement once my itinerary was locked in, although a tad ambitious I have to admit, was palpable.<details class="para"><summary>Read more</summary>

          So with everything lined up, it was time to make the most of my time in Cebu, the historic capital of the Visayas. I commenced my adventures by hailing a local bus on the main road outside the hostel, for the 2.5 hour commute south to Moalboal. The little tourist town is very cool, and famous for the sardine run just offshore. Adventurers head out from the shore with a snorkelling guide, and before I knew it I was confronted with the most enormous school of 
fish any traveller could possibly see in a lifetime of travel. The fish are densely packed and seemed to move in synch when disturbed, for example if a snorkeller dives down to where they are swimming. My guide is one of those free diving legends, who got some amazing gopro footage right up close with what seems to be millions of fish. He then took me closer to shore where we interacted with a sea turtle for ages in shallow water. What a cool experience, these sea animals are just amazing! With a low pressure system in full swing, the visibility was far from perfect on the day, nevertheless it was an awesome experience. The bus ride back to my hostel took forever with the heavy evening traffic, A tip for the uninitiated, Sunday is a family day in the Philippines, and as such is the worst possible time to be on the roads!

Next I headed in to the historic centre of Cebu to explore the tourist attractions, and they are all within walking distance once a taxi has been arranged to a central stop off point. There are magnificent churches, a very cool fort,the Cebu monumment,fort, in the capital of the Visayas. The staff and guests back at the hostel are so friendly and welcoming, after a few days in the Philippines the cares of the world seem to vanish for visitors to this fabulous destination. But soon it was time to push on to make the most of a packed itinerary.

Bohol is a famous island in the Visayas, and just a two hour ferry ride out of Cebu. Fortunately the seas were calm on this trip and I had made a booking at what turned out to be a party hostel near the beach in the north of the island. I settled in to my room after a good meal at the restaurant, and watched all the wild partying from the balcony. There were drinking games, beer pong and the like... lots of crazy stuff for crazy young people, but it's all good. The staff at the hostel are so friendly and kind, I scoped out another low key hostel and was planning to move, but had already rented a motorbike and booked on a few tours with Mad Monkey so decided to stick visit. There were so many cancellations of various boat tours due to the low pressure system, it seemed like every morning I would wake up at 5:00am to be told another tour had been cancelled, and it was back to bed. To my regret this also included swimming with whale sharks, which still will have to remain near the top of the bucket list. There was a break in the weather one day, and I enjoyed a visit to the beautiful Alona beach, despite the wind blowing sand everywhere! I also booked a tour to visit the Chocolate Hills, a famous natural attraction on the island. On the way back my guide stopped off at the Tarsier Sanctuary, where I got to marvel at these tiny shy creatures. They look part lemur, part alien, and are totally enthralling little guys. A visit to Hinagdanan Cave was another highlight of my visit, despite the throng of tourists all jammed in there.

I took the opportunity to book a fast ferry across to Siquijor for a lightning overnight stay. planned, Perhaps this was not a good idea, I was starting to think, as I had to hold my arm against the window which kept coming open, thereby flooding myself and the poor passengers behind me as the massive seas washed over the boat. However, following a safe arrival I was glad I took the plunge, so to speak. Siquijor is hard to describe, I guess you could say it's really small and way off the beaten track. The lodgings were fine, and I organised a half day tour with a guide the next morning before he dropped my back at the ferry terminal for a late afternoon ferry ride back to Bohol. The tour was awesome, there were spectacular beaches, lovely little waterfalls, a visit to a famous church and monastery. It was an excellent little introduction to this unique little island, and I'm glad to have made the effort to visit the island.

Thankfully my return to Bohol was in calmer seas, although the ferry departed three hours behind schedule and there was absolutely no communication from the staff at the terminal. In fact, when I politely enquired on an departure time I was made to feel like I was the one with the problem. "It's at sea" the guys would say, or "it's coming". They displayed scarcely believable levels of nonchalance, but that's life on the road from time to time! So to recap... here I am, ten days in to the trip and already tearing around the islands like a madman. It doesn't matter where you are or who you meet, the Filipino people are brilliant hosts and the scenery and attractions in the Philippines are first class, basically all of you should be here now!

         <div id="para1_1"><h2>Huizhou #1: West Lake Sunset</h2><img src="P1img1.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="image"><p class="para1" id="para11_1">Finally, off to visit Huizhou, a smaller city that is close to Shenzhen. Even though Huizhou is really close getting there is a bit of a pain in the backside. I opted for the slower cheaper route of subway and bus. Subway was nice and simple just ride it to the end of line 3 and then transfer to the bus. Although the bus took just over 2 hours and wasn’t the most comfortable as it was just a regular bus, not a fancy coach or anything, it was actually less faff than getting the train and having to go through all the security and ID checks. It was also a bargainous 9 RMB. China isn’t too cheap any more but there are still some good deals about. The journey was uneventful and I just watched the countryside and various industrial estates and small towns as we drove by. It was about a ten minute walk to my guesthouse and I liked the area I walked through. The room wasn’t ready so I had to wait a while for the cleaner to finish, bit annoying as I got there well after check-in time opened. The room was really nice though and 
worth the short wait.

            <details class="para1"><summary>Read more</summary>First things first, I was starving, so time to order some food. I have been enjoying little dishes a lot recently so I ordered some of those. I didn’t have to wait too long for them to turn up. I ordered stir fried cabbage, sweet and sour pork, and pork with preserved mustard greens (梅菜扣肉 mei cai kou rou). The cabbage was okay, not the most flavoursome of dishes. It was meant to have chilli in it, but there was little to no kick from it. It also needed a good dousing in vinegar. The sweet and sour pork was good. I don’t eat it very often and I really should eat it more as it is always tasty. I just kind of forget about it. Pork and preserved mustard greens is one of my favourite dishes. It is a Hakka dish (The Hakka are people originally from Northern China that migrated south centuries ago to escape persecution), which is a type of cuisine found in parts of Southern China and should be more well known internationally in my opinion. The pork is pork belly thinly sliced and placed on top of the mustard greens. 
It is the perfect combination of meat and fat. It is salty with a sweet tinge, not too sweet and melts in the mouth. After that feast, I needed a bit of a rest. I think I am still recovering from my outing to Hong Kong too.

After I pulled myself round, it was time to head out and see a bit of Huizhou. I was staying near West Lake, which is one of the main attractions in Huizhou. Huizhou is pretty spread out and when I was doing some research getting to the coastal areas or to the scenic areas in the hills would be a 2+ hour ordeal each way. Since it was too hot for that, I decided to just spend my time around West Lake. Most cities seem to have an East or West Lake and I have been to a few of them in different places; Huizhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Hangzhou. Huizhou’s West Lake was said to have been as famous as Hangzhou’s West Lake in the past. I headed through the small alleyway admiring the murals painted on the walls. They were all food related so I think they were an advertisement for the very busy restaurant at the bottom of the street. I crossed the road and was at the edge of the lake. It was nice to stand under the shade of the trees and watch both tourists and locals enjoying the area. I was surprised that it wasn’t busier. I presume more people are trying to stay out of the heat. I liked the area by the lake. You could see that it was being gentrified, which in my opinion is a good thing. The first floors of the buildings had been renovated and looked clean and modern, while the upper floors were more worn out and peeling. There were lots of cute and cosy looking guesthouses, restaurants and cafes.
<img src="P1img2.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="image">
I headed in one direction along the side of the lake. I could see the sun was starting to set and spent ages taking pictures of it. The sky had a lovely slightly yellowy orange tinge to it and the sun was reflected off the water. I enjoyed my walk and stopped in a few places just to take in the view, people watch and read. I also liked that if you looked in different directions you got different 
views; of the ancient and the modern. In some directions you could see the different attractions around the lake such as pagodas, pavilions and bridges, while looking in other directions you could see the modernity of the city with its high rise hotels, offices and apartment buildings. It was a good mix. The sky turned a nice shade of pink as the sun set further and the buildings started to light up. It was really pretty, but far too hot and humid. I was walking at a snail’s pace around the lake and the sweat was dripping off me. Even when I was sitting relaxing it didn’t stop. 30℃ at 7:30 pm is still too much for me. After walking in a couple of different directions around the section of the lake close to my guesthouse, it was time to retreat to under the air conditioning with some icy cold water.

         <div id="para1_2"><h2>Safari: Tanzania - Ngorongoro Part 1, Tuesday 2022 November 8</h2><img src="P2img1.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="image"><p class="para2" id="para11_2">Ngorongoro Crater is not a crater, but a twelve-mile-wide caldera with no breaks in the walls, the largest in the world. I regretted not taking any photos in full light from my balcony, but there was no time after breakfast before leaving at 6:30.

The day more than made up for it. At the gate to Ngorongoro, Lucas obtained our permit and other paperwork. Later he explained that per person the permit fee was $80, plus a conservation fee of $70, added to the $350 for the night at the hotel, plus $300 per vehicle – a sizeable portion of the cost of our whole trip!

We descended an 11% grade on a fairly good stone rode. Between the large bushes, trees and grasses, we could see the wide golden plain surrounded by a rim of mountainous hills. Descending the wall of the caldera was like descending into geological history. I kept imagining the terrible force that ripped apart a mountain and created a wide expanse of flat land. All the debris was driven west into what we now call the Serengeti. Eons of time let nature transform rock into rich soil that grew lush vegetation. 

            <details class="para2"><summary>Read more</summary> And, the animals 

came. Almost biblical.

Switchbacks took us safely to the bottom. We could see a large herd of wildebeest and zebras, so common to the entire ecological zone. We spent the morning, bouncing slowly along roads that might be impassible in the wet season. Whenever we saw something, our drivers stopped and we clambered onto the seats to get good views from the pop-up roof.

Early on we saw a lion family, right by the road. The family must have had a kill overnight, because their bellies were stretched. They ignored us, but we were excited to see a large female cross the road in front of us. Several steps into the grass, we laughed as she took a dump and walked back to where the family were resting under a large bush. The mother laid down and began to lick first one cub and then another with great thoroughness. The cubs loved the attention – gentle mutual affection was touching. After a while, first one female and then the other walked over to another bush farther away. The two older cubs sat at attention and kept their eyes on the females, probably waiting for a signal to join 
them safely. Eventually, they saw or heard something we did not, and they crossed over. The three younger cubs kept playing; one unfortunately had a plastic bottle that provided it with endless fun crunching it with satisfying crackling noises. The mother came back, and after a while, so did the others.

When we moved on, to let other vehicles watch the family life, we saw a solitary young male nearby, probably part of the same family. His mane was fairly short and still golden in colour. His stomach may have hurt it was so full – he had a hard time finding a comfortable position to sleep it off!


<img src="P2img2.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="image">
Later in the morning, we saw a tiny baby Thomson’s Gazelle next to its mother. Only about two days old, the fawn’s markings were smudged and camouflaged him in the dull-coloured grass. He trotted after his mother, and as she munched grass he wandered away. She didn’t seem concerned, so perhaps there were no predators around. In due course, he returned to her and helped himself to a good meal of milk. How astonishing to be watching a gazelle nurse in the wild!

Small lakes (at least in Soda (salt) lake
the dry season), a stream and a marsh attracted a lot of birds, as well as mammals. First we saw flamingos sitting in the water, only a few standing in that distinctive flamingo way. These birds are white, because they filter feed on algae, rather than shrimps. Some time later, we saw another flock, more recognizable because most were standing.

Two large flocks of pelicans stood waiting for something or looking for something – not feeding, at least. Near a big hippo pool, a flock of Ruffs were feeding in the marsh. Several types of herons strutted slowly, looking for frogs or other edibles – no fish. A Black Crake walked on four half-submerged hippos, pecking insects off their backs.

Our elevation: 1730 metres

It didn’t happen!! Chris was up at 6.00am (I was up at 7.00am!!) breakfast and ready for the off at 9.00am. We were 3rd in the queue!! Then the Captain came on the tannoy and said that because it was a tender Port, the swell and wind were too strong, but it was due to drop down in the morning, so he was going to wait for ½ hr. This was a bit annoying as we had a car booked, ready to explore the island, and it was a lovely sunny day!!

He came back on at 9.30am and said the wind and swell were still too strong, so he said he would wait for another 1hour.

At ½ 10 he came back on and said the same thing!! The winds and swell were still too strong, and the decision would be made in 1hr!!

Found out quite a bit about the hurricane while we were waiting!! Spoke to a woman who had a table fall on her in the Borough

            <details class="para3"><summary>Read more</summary>Market who had to have 17 stitches in her ankle and missed most of 

the Ports because she was still hobbling around on crutches!! She also said that a lot of people were falling over up there!! Another woman said that the ship had failed the engine test in St Johns and was unworthy to sail and she thought it would probably be impounded! I just wish they would hurry up and get all the lifts working again – there seems to be only one working in each block of three lifts now!! (They were making a bad sort of knocking sound in the hurricane!!) Eventually we got fed up with waiting in the Centre Court we went up to deck 14, and could see that the Tender boats were being tossed about in the sea – so we didn’t hold out much hope!

It ended up even worse!! The Captain came over then tannoy at 12.30pm and said the wind and swell was still strong and that we wouldn’t be going to Iles de la Madeleine and also because there were gale force 10 winds due we wouldn’t be travelling north to Iceland either!! Instead we would go to Cobh, S.Ireland on the 12th October and Honfleur, France on the 14th October…..both 
places we hadn’t been too!! The Penis Museum in Iceland (the only one in the World!!) will have to wait until next time!!

<img src="P3img2.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="image">
Didn’t do a lot else – felt quite deflated! Had a lunch with a couple whose husband was making plans with a single girl to go on a World Cruise! The wife didn’t seem to mind!! Sat and sunbathed and read my book around the pool., Chris got his book by Nick Hewer “My Alphabet A life from A-Z” (bought from a charity shop for 50p just before the cruise!!) signed by the man himself! (Nick used to be Lord Alan Sugar’s right hand man on “The Apprentice” and also hosted “Countdown” for 9 years.

We now have 5 sea days……..
